We will go through the loan application in detail and ask more questions or for additional documentation where necessary. It will take approximately 2-3 days to evaluate the application and write the loan application, assuming all paperwork is in place. After the final examination is made the loan will be opened for investing on the platform. 

The syndication process can take anything from a few minutes up to 2 weeks. How fast the project is funded depends mostly on the attractiveness of the project.</div>
