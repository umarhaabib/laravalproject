<p>A good number of people miss out on the
wealth-building benefits of investing because of the associated risks. To them,
investing is like staking their hard-earned money in a game of blackjack.</p>



<p>The current economic downturn only seems
to prove them right. Equity markets around the world are nosediving, leaving
investors scrambling for fast liquidity and safe-havens for their hard-earned
cash. </p>



<span id="more-3221"></span>



<p>Investing can be risky, of course, but
there are time-tested strategies to hedge against risk and protect your funds.
Diversification is the process of spreading investments across various
instruments, sectors, and other categories to reduce risk. The idea is to
invest in different areas that won&#8217;t react the same way to an unfavorable
event.</p>



<p>Although it doesn&#8217;t totally eliminate
risks, diversifying your investment portfolio is the best way to reach your
long-term financial goals while keeping your risks to a minimum. </p>



<p>Let&#8217;s
dig into the reasons why it&#8217;s essential to diversify your portfolio and how
best to go about it.</p>



<h2>Step 1:
Understand the need for diversification</h2>



<p>The
chief argument for diversification is risk reduction. There is a degree of
uncertainty in every financial market; hence you risk losing it all if you put
all your money in one company&#8217;s shares. In the same way, you could lose money
if you invest it all in one asset class – say real estate or equity in a single
business. An adverse event, such as the housing crisis of 2008, will leave you
with nothing.</p>



<p>Fortunately,
all markets cannot crash at the same time and in the same manner. Therein lies
the straightforward beauty of diversification. When you spread your investments
across different companies and different investment classes, you reduce the
effect an isolated catastrophe will have on your portfolio.</p>



<h2>Step 2: Balance
your risk-return appetite </h2>



<p>Before you rush to buy into any
financial product, lured by promises of fantastic returns, also bear in mind
that the investment is likely high risk. In other words, to make high returns,
be ready to carry high risk. The higher-than-average returns on your investment
are the reward for taking on high volatility. Therefore, before investing, it&#8217;s
crucial you know the amount of risk you&#8217;re capable of taking to give the
commensurate returns </p>



<p>Take
your time to balance your appetite for returns with the possible risks. Making
investment decisions based on careful consideration of the levels of risks and
returns ensures you&#8217;ll enjoy higher returns in the long term. For instance,
stocks offer some of the highest levels of returns, and hence, are attractive
to investors. However,&nbsp; investors who put
all their money in stocks prior to the spectacular market crashes of 1929,
1987, and 2009 must have learned the bitter lesson that investing in stocks
alone is not a sound financial strategy.</p>



<h2>Step 3: Keep an
emergency cash reserve </h2>



<p>According
to experts, you should keep some cash as an emergency fund to cover living
expenses for a minimum of six months. This emergency cash reserve may be
domiciled in your bank account, or if you choose to invest it, in a money
market account, certificate of deposits, or similar alternatives. </p>



<p>An
emergency cash reserve will see you through tough times without having to
liquidate your assets. Force-selling your assets at the wrong time could mean
more taxes and lower returns, and this at a time you desperately need money. </p>



<p>Another
reason – mostly used by wealthy investors &#8211; to keep cash is to use it to buy up
assets when the economy tanks. They
keep the money to exploit opportunities such as those that arise in a financial
crisis when assets can be bought cheaply.</p>



<p>Finally,
including cash in your portfolio gives you a liquidity reserve you can draw on
when the stock markets close for extended periods. These are situations where
it won&#8217;t even be possible to liquidate assets.</p>



<p>As
a rule-of-thumb, you should allocate no less than 5% of your portfolio to cash.
Some experts say that 10 – 20%, at a minimum, will give you the best
risk/return trade-off.</p>



<h2>Step 4: Consider ETFs over single stocks</h2>



<p>A
single stock has varying risks or volatility, which depends on the stock, the sector,
the market, and the economy. An adverse event in the industry or market poses
considerable risks to any holdings in the stock of a company in that industry.</p>



<p>On
the other hand, ETFs are less risky because they consist of a bouquet of
investments. In order words, they are already diversified. Depending on what is
in the actual ETF, an unfavourable turn in the market is less likely to affect
all the investments in the ETF the same way. However, bear in mind that
expected rewards are lower with fewer risks. </p>



<p>Asides
from being safer than individual stocks, ETFs can be bought and sold just like
stocks, and they typically cost less in terms of fees.</p>



<h2>Step 5: Step up your ETF game with
All-in-One ETFs</h2>



<p>An
all-in-one ETF is made up of several &#8220;sub-ETFs&#8221; and provides an
extensive portfolio of diverse assets in one ETF. It gives you more
diversification – across markets in North America and emerging and developed
international markets than a regular ETF. Furthermore, it offers you a broader
portfolio, just like those provided by Robo-adviser, at a lower cost.</p>



<p>Investing
in all-in-one ETFs also gives you the convenience of automatic rebalancing to
ensure your portfolio maintains the desired investment objectives. It can be
set-up for a specific investment goal, aligning with your risk appetite and
tolerance. These investment objectives are classified under income, balanced,
conservative, and growth. And much like regular ETFs and stocks, an all-in-one
ETF can be traded on a stock exchange.</p>



<h2>Step 6: Let a Robo advisor do the
thinking</h2>



<p>Robo-advisors are the AI equivalent of wealth
managers. Powered by technology, they typically invest in low-cost ETFs. For a
relatively small fee, they do all the heavy lifting for you, so you never have
to bother about rebalancing or portfolio diversification.&nbsp; Investing with Robo-advisors is best for you
if you want to optimize your portfolio but do not have the time or skills to
actively manage them yourself.</p>



<p>Robo-advisors use technology to simplify
and automate the investing process. When you open a new account with a Robo-advisor, you
supply them with information regarding your investment objectives, risk
tolerance, and time frame. You can modify these preferences at any time. The Robo-advisor
then uses this information to profile your risk tolerance, figure out suitable
asset allocation across the different instruments, and select a diversified
portfolio. You can set up automatic contributions to your new account and start
investing right away.</p>



<h2>Step 7: Dip your toes in the real
estate market</h2>



<p>A well-diversified portfolio would be
incomplete without real estate allocations. Investments in city real estate are
resilient and have a track record of excellent performance in times of inflation.
Time and again, the urban property market has recovered at record speeds, to
the great benefit of its investors.&nbsp; </p>



<p>In general, real estate is uncorrelated
to stocks and bonds and, therefore, does not move directly with them. When the
economy is in trouble, no market is left untouched. However, bricks and mortar
in Europe’s metropolises have historically offered a powerful hedge against a
market downturn, as these <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/nl/Documents/financial-services/deloitte-nl-fsi-property-index-2019.pdf">appreciate
in price over the long run</a>.</p>



<p>If
you are a risk-averse investor, allocating assets to real estate is ideal,
especially during bear markets.</p>



<p>Luckily,
anyone has the chance to become a property investor through the means of <a href="https://ampleinvest.com/best-european-real-estate-crowdfunding/">modern
real estate crowdfunding</a>. For small sums, you can lend money to
real estate developers against fixed, double-digit annual returns. Another
popular method is the buy-to-let model, where private individuals pool funds
together to buy and rent out properties to tenants. This way, investors benefit
from the increasing property value while receiving monthly rent payments. </p>



<h2>Step 8: Rebalance your portfolio
yearly</h2>



<p>Portfolio rebalancing is the practice of adjusting
the asset allocation of your portfolio to revert to your preferred portfolio
mix, and ultimately, to your investment objectives.</p>



<p>To achieve a desired financial goal, you allocate
assets accordingly, based on your risk tolerance, amongst the different
investments that make up your portfolio. For example, if you&#8217;re in your early
30s and years from retirement, your asset allocation may tend towards riskier
high yield investments. </p>



<p>With time, the pre-set balance of the different
assets starts to change as their value increases or decreases. A particular
stock may experience such high returns that it makes up a more substantial part
of your total portfolio than you want.</p>



<p>It then becomes necessary to rebalance your portfolio
by reallocating assets, returning them to their original mix.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Diversification
is a formidable element of a sound investment strategy. You must consider how
much risk you can tolerate and how much time you have before settling on the
portfolio mix that will give you the desired outcomes.</p>
