(a)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;may not be less than EUR 50; and<br />

6.2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In the case where during the Syndication Period the requested amount is aggregated and the Loan Contracts are concluded, the Portal Operator may transfer the loan amount to an account (e.g. such as a notary&lsquo;s deposit account, escrow etc.), where the loan amount will be held until the Borrower satisfies all conditions necessary for the disbursement to the Borrower (such account where the loan amount is to be held before the disbursement to the Borrower shall be selected at the discretion of the Portal Operator). The loan amount shall be paid out to the bank account indicated by the Borrower only after carrying out of the actions provided for in these User Terms as well as in the respective Loan Contract.

Investors shall be ranked in both parts of the list according to the most recent transaction made by the Auto Invest application so that the highest rank shall be assigned to the Investor whose funds were used to make a transaction the longest time ago. If the funds of an Investor have not been used via the Auto Invest application, the ranking of the Investor in the list shall be determined, in addition to the size of the investment requested by them, by the time of activation of the Auto Invest application.

7.8.3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;if the loan amount set out in the Loan Request is smaller than the amount that would be received if each Investor who uses Auto Invest and to the criteria established by whom the application corresponds, invested the minimum amount permitted by the application, then:<br />

11.2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If a User must perform any financial obligation, there must be, no later than on the day when that financial obligation becomes due (or in cases specified in the User Terms, on the day when that financial obligation is committed to), free funds on the User&#39;s Account for the purpose of performing the relevant obligation in an amount equal to the amount necessary for performance of that financial obligation in full.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>12.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;PAYMENT DEFAULTS AND OTHER BREACHES</strong></p>

<p>12.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If a Borrower does not perform any obligations arising from a Loan Contract, these User Terms or other Loan Documents, in a timely manner, or if a ground for extraordinary cancellation of a Loan Contract arises, the Portal Operator and/or Security Agent can at the expense of the Debtor conduct any actions or take steps on behalf of the Lender(s) and/or itself that the Portal Operator and/or the Security Agent considers at their own discretion to be necessary or desirable to achieve the performance of the relevant obligation and/or cancellation of the Loan Contract or the use of another legal remedy.<br />

12.3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;By registering as a User, each user gives instructions, consent and authorisation to the Portal Operator and the Security Agent, with the right of sub-delegation, to carry out, on behalf of the User and as their representative, the actions and steps described in clauses 12.1 to 12.2 of these User Terms at their own discretion, with the Portal Operator and the Security Agent being entitled to use third persons for the carrying out of such actions and steps. The above described instructions and authorisation also include the right of the Portal Operator and the Security Agent to perform any action and/or transaction on behalf of and as a representative of the User which in the Portal Operator&#39;s and/or Security Agent&#39;s opinion is necessary for the assignment described in clause 12.6 to be valid.<br />

12.7.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Assignment Notice referred to in clause 12.6 of these User Terms may be delivered only when the Loan Contract(s) entered into for funding of the relevant Project is/are extraordinarily cancelled by the procedure prescribed in the other provisions of this clause 12 (Payment defaults and other breaches) and in the opinion of the Portal Operator or the Security Agent the above described assignment is necessary or desirable so that the Portal Operator and/or Security Agent could be the creditor of the Debtor in respect of the Due Claims and to participate in its own name in a proceedings or actions for the collection of the Due Claims and/or other form of enforcement.<br />
12.8.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Following the assignment described in clause 13.6 of these User Terms, the Portal Operator and/or the Security Agent continues to act in the interests of the Lender(s) in respect of the assigned claims (being, inter alia, entitled to carry out any actions and steps described in clauses 13.1 to 13.4 of these User Terms) and reflects the funds received as the result of collecting and/or enforcing of the Due Claims on the Accounts of the relevant Lender(s) (having previously deducted and paid all costs and fees related to the relevant actions and steps).<br />
12.9.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Portal Operator and/or the Security Agent may cease to carry out the actions and/or steps described in this clause 12, or not apply them, if in the Portal Operator&#39;s and/or Security Agent&#39;s opinion performance of the Due Claims is unlikely as the result of the relevant actions and steps or the benefit likely to be received as the result of the relevant actions and steps is less or in a similar scale with the expected costs of the relevant actions and steps. Following delivery of the notice of cessation, on request of the Lender, the Portal Operator and/or Security Agent may (but is not required to) re-assign to the Lender at the cost of the Lender the Due Claim(s) previously assigned by that Lender to the Portal Operator or the Security Agent pursuant to the procedure of clause 12.6 of the User Terms.</p>

<p>13.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The security/securities referred to in the Principal Loan Terms must be established in favour of Tetenter tagatisagent O&Uuml; (or its legal successor) which is the Security Agent.

13.3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If the Security Agent has received funds for the Lender and/or Portal Operator as a result of actions carried out with the aim of collection or enforcement of any claims (including realisation of security), the Security Agent transfers the relevant funds to the Portal Operator (having previously deducted and paid all costs and fees incurred or calculated by it in relation to the relevant actions) who records the relevant proceeds on the Lender(s) Accounts in the relevant amounts. The above also applies in a situation where the Security Agent has carried out the relevant collection or other enforcement actions on a ground arising from any agreement on parallel obligation provided for in the Tetenter General Loan Terms and/or in the agreement establishing the relevant security.<br />
13.4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Security Agent keeps the funds referred to in clause 13.3 as a mandatary in the Security Agent&#39;s own name on a current account that the Security Agent has opened for that purpose in a licenced credit institution registered in the commercial register in Estonia, a foreign country affiliate of a licenced credit institution registered in the commercial register in Estonia or in a licenced credit institution which is registered or which has a place of business in another contracting member state of the European Economic Area.
