This will enable us to verify your bank account. If the verified bank account belongs to the investor, the new bank account details are automatically saved on the virtual platform. When making future withdrawals, you can choose to which linked bank account you wish to conduct withdrawals.                                            </div>

                                                Development loan is a loan used to finance the development's planning process or the development/construction of the property itself.
A bridge loan is a short-term loan used to meet current obligations before securing a permanent financing option, enhancing the value of the property or selling the underlying asset.
A business loan is a loan used to raise capital for supporting the day-to-day activities of the firm, business expansion, acquisition of equipment or goods, cover pending obligations (taxes, etc.). Despite the loan type, all Tetenter's loans are secured with a mortgage.                                            </div>
