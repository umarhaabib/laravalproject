                                                Our stress-test shows that if you have diversified your investment portfolio enough then it can handle stressful economic situations in a better manner. We have seen that investors prefer higher interest which in a standard economic situation indicates a higher risk. Therefore, in order to take measures to protect our retail investors we have limited the amount from which you can start choosing different criteria to ensure that smaller investors have as diversified portfolio as possible. Alternatively, investors have the chance to investigate each project separately by choosing to invest manually.                                            </div>
