                                                Development loan is a loan used to finance the development's planning process or the development/construction of the property itself.
A bridge loan is a short-term loan used to meet current obligations before securing a permanent financing option, enhancing the value of the property or selling the underlying asset.
A business loan is a loan used to raise capital for supporting the day-to-day activities of the firm, business expansion, acquisition of equipment or goods, cover pending obligations (taxes, etc.). Despite the loan type, all Tetenter's loans are secured with a mortgage.                                            </div>

                                                Many developers face the challenge in which the current value of their development object does not enable them to raise the capital that is needed to complete the development object entirely. As Tetenter only lends against the current value of the collateral not the future value, then for development loans we often make use of the stage financing method. This means that when the first investment round of an object enables the borrower to increase the collateral value of the property by developing the object further, then in the context of the given LTV the investment amount can increase via next stages of the loan. All loans are funded solely based on the current value of the object and a precondition for every stage is a new updated valuation report of the collateral.                                            </div>

 	 Tetenter will assess the borrower’s creditworthiness, business plan, and the appraisal report of the collateral, to ensure the borrower is able to make the loan repayments and to avoid a situation, where investors' capital is at risk. 
 	 After approval of the loan request, the loan will be released on the Tetenter platform, where investors can assess the risk and invest into the loan. 
 	 When the loan is funded, the pledge will be created and the loan will be paid out to the borrower. 
 	 In case the loan does not get funded, the contracts will end instantly and all the invested funds will be released to the respective investors' accounts. The borrower also has the option to accept only the amount that was raised. 
 	 The borrower is obliged to make the repayments according to the agreed repayment schedule. The investors can track all repayments on the portfolio page and withdraw or reinvest all the receivables.                                            </div>
