                                        Tetenter investors can earn an extra bonus by inviting their friends, acquaintances, and family members to join the platform. To receive your bonus, you should share your personal referral code (your EGU code) with the potential new investor. You can find your code at the top of your virtual account page or under the referral program sub-menu in the account settings section. For each new investor who joins and provides your code, we will give you a 0.5% bonus on any investment they make in the first three months after their account activation. This bonus will be credited to your investment account after the project the friend invested in gets funded. The same bonus is given to your friend, who also earns a 0.5% bonus on their first three months of investment.

                                        Development loan is a loan used to finance the development&#39;s planning process or the development/construction of the property itself.
A bridge loan is a short-term loan used to meet current obligations before securing a permanent financing option, enhancing the value of the property or selling the underlying asset.
A business loan is a loan used to raise capital for supporting the day-to-day activities of the firm, business expansion, acquisition of equipment or goods, cover pending obligations (taxes, etc.). Despite the loan type, all Tetenter&#39;s loans are secured with a mortgage.

                                        Many developers face the challenge in which the current value of their development object does not enable them to raise the capital that is needed to complete the development object entirely. As Tetenter only lends against the current value of the collateral not the future value, then for development loans we often make use of the stage financing method. This means that when the first investment round of an object enables the borrower to increase the collateral value of the property by developing the object further, then in the context of the given LTV the investment amount can increase via next stages of the loan. All loans are funded solely based on the current value of the object and a precondition for every stage is a new updated valuation report of the collateral.

                                        All the loans are backed with a mortgage. 

Once the loan is fully invested, the borrower has to go to the notary office and enter into an agreement with the Security Agent to create a mortgage. The mortgage will then be registered at the Land Register (with the Security Agent as mortgagee on behalf of the investors). 

The Security Agent is a separate limited liability company whose primary purpose is to hold securities for the benefit of investors making investments via Tetenter. The name of the entity is Tetenter Tagatisagent OÜ. The entity is controlled by the leading Baltic law office of Triniti

Like with most forms of investing, peer-to-peer lending carries a degree of risk. We reduce this risk to our investors by conducting thorough due diligence and by taking asset security on every loan, in case the borrower is unable to repay their loan. Tetenter does not guarantee your loans.

                                        After the credit crunch and the resultant recession, the risk appetite of banks was reduced significantly, which means that banks have tightened their lending criteria. Banks have strict criteria, which is not borrower friendly and thus many loan applications are rejected by banks. 

Tetenter is a small and flexible organization which is willing to help companies that are denied financing by banks despite their strong business plan and solid collateral.

                                        An unsecured loan is a loan which does not have any collateral in place, such as land or apartment, and is solely based on a borrower’s credit history and potential ability to repay. Secured loans have assets as collateral so that if a borrower cannot repay the loan, Tetenter&#39;s security agent represented by a law firm Triniti will start the asset sales process. Hereby, the risk of losing the money is minimized..

                                        As soon as the borrower is late in repaying an instalment, we will make contact on behalf of our investors to find out the reason behind the delay. In case of a delay, the borrower shall pay an indemnity specified in the general loan terms. When the borrower faces financial difficulties, we will try to find the best solution for both parties. If the borrower is unable to repay the loan, we will cooperate with our debt collection partners and security agent to recover the debt.

                                        The interest that you receive from borrowers is gross income, which means that Tetenter does not deduct any tax from the amount. All interest earned from loans is treated by tax authorities as investment income and thus subject to income tax. Investors have the possibility to postpone paying the income tax by investing through a juridical entity, but will still be liable for tax. Tetenter does not provide tax-related advice and recommend that you turn to a local tax advisor for additional information.
